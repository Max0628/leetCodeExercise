/**
 * 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III Medium Topics premium lock icon Companies Hint Given a binary
 * array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can
 * flip at most k 0's.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2 Output: 6 Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
 * [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
 * [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
 * Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined. Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3 Output: 10 Explanation:
 * [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1] Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest
 * subarray is underlined.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 105 nums[i] is either 0 or 1. 0 <= k <= nums.length
